HumanForYou, an India-based pharmaceutical company with around 4,000 employees, is grappling with a 15% annual turnover rate. This high turnover is causing project delays, damaging the company's reputation, and necessitating a large HR department to continuously recruit replacements. Additionally, the time and resources spent on training new employees lead to productivity losses.
